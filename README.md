This package provides the code for the interface registry. for more information please 
refer to material in doc/*.

The code has been tested on Cadence IUS 14.* but may also run on earlier versions. To run on other platforms such as VCS/Questa you have to adjust the code for the interface self reference (tb_vif.sv) which is non standard (see paper) and eventually modify the compilation arguments stored in the  .f file.

please direct questions and suggestions to uwes@cadence.com
